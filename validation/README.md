### Scripts for Advanced Analysis Validation

Place candidate validation scripts, or exemplar scripts that could be adapted into more generic validation scripts into this directory or subdirectories thereof.

Feel free to create subdirectories that segregate scripts on the basis of functionality, author, applicable VEGAS stages or any other criteria you feel is sensible.

Try to document the functionality of your scripts. This can either be done inline, within the code or in separate README files. 

Collaboration with other developers to share the burden of developing robust, reasonably generic and ideally future-proof validation scripts.
